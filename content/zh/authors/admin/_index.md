I'm Zehui Qu (@zququ), Phd candidate at China Agricultural University, department of veterinary microbiology and immunology. <br><br>
My work mainly focuses on the structural study of the bat MHC I, trying to reveal its peptide presentation characteristic. 
The other part of my work focuses on the cryo-em structure study of feline calicivirus, an important virus to cat. <br><br>
My research interests include vaccine design of animal infectious disease based on crystallography and cryo-em. And paticularly, I am very interested in cryo electron microscope and *hoping to find a post-doc position on cryo-em algorithm development.*<br><br>
Find my detail information in CV. <br><br>
Please feel free to contact me.
